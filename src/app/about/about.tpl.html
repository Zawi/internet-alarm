        <p>
            This web app is designed to help you <strong>wake up with the sounds you like</strong>.
            They may be songs, mixes, playlists, recorded radio shows or live web radio stations! <br/>
            Setting an alarm is as easy as choosing the time and pasting the link of a website.
            You can manage a <strong>list of alarms</strong> which will still be there when you come back another time. <br/>
            This app can be used on a computer with speakers or a mobile; you only need to keep the browser opened.
