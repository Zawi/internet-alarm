# Internet Alarm

An alarm clock web-app, in the browser, based on Angular.js.

Demo: http://zawi.github.io/internet-alarm/

***

## What is it?

This web app is designed to help you *wake up with the sounds you like*.
They may be songs, mixes, playlists, recorded radio shows or live web radio stations!


Setting an alarm is as easy as choosing the time and pasting the link of a website.
You can manage a *list of alarms* which will still be there when you come back another time.


This app can be used on a computer with speakers or a mobile; you only need to keep the browser opened.

## Quick Start

From [ngBoilerplate](http://joshdmiller.github.com/ng-boilerplate)

Install Node.js and then:

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/zawi/internet-alarm
$ cd ng-boilerplate
$ sudo npm -g install grunt-cli karma bower
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt watch
```

Finally, open `file:///path/to/internet-alarm/build/index.html` in your browser.

Happy hacking!
